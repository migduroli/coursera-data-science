# R programming course

This course is devoted to studying the basic tools to start working with R programming language. There are plenty of books, manuals, tutorials, etc. that can be used to complement this course indeed. The programme is structured in four weeks and the material coded while watching the lectures are collected in here accordingly. 

## Week 1:  Getting Started and R Nuts and Bolts

This week is where the very basics of the language are presented. In the folder Week 1 one finds the *.R files coded while reading the notes to get the hands on:

* R-language history and Introduction to the console evaluation
* Data Types: objects, vectors, lists, matrices, factors, missing values (NA and NaN), data frames 
* Reading data from files: tabular data, large table (RAM rules and speeding up the process by sapply(classes))
* Subsetting: from single to double bracket, passing through the dollar symbol. 
* Removing missing values: creating boolean vectors identifying the wrong-value (NA) positions.

## Week 2: Programming with R

The second week of the course is devoted to learning the basic 
structures and flow control mechanisms that R language offers you. They will be fundamental for the understanding of the scripts we will be studying along the course, for sure, but more importantly to start envisaging the pros of using a high-level and high-efficient scripting language. The main objects we explore are:

* Control structures
* Functions
* Scoping (rules and environments)
* Coding standards
* Dates and times

## Week 3: Loop Functions and Debugging

In this week, one of the most important and relevant structures are studied in high detail, namely, loop fucntions. These are so important in the R ecosystem because they allow to automatise complicated tasks in a very compact way. We will study:

* Lapply
* Sapply
* Mapply
* Split

To finish the module we will also see some debugging tools.

## Week 4: Simulation & Profiling

The last week of the course is aimed at studying the basics of simulating random numbers with several random distributions. Besides, we will learn the way of measuring the efficiency of our code by profiling it with professional tools provided by R.
