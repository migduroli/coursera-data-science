# Raw and processed data:

# Definition:
# Data are values of qualitatively of quantitative variables, 
# belonging to a set of environments

# Data processing is part of the data analysis
# Pre-processing steps should always been recorded step-by-step!!!

# The goal is going from RAW to tidy data sets, for sure,
# but in the process of extrcting the data we want in an
# tractable maner we can affect quite a lot the final result. This is
# why it's so important to keep track of every step

# Four things we should have always:
## The raw data
## The tidy data
## The metadata (code book explaining the variables etc)
## Exact recipies to go from raw to tidy+metadata [Instruction list]
