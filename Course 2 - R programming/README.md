# R programming course

This course is devoted to studying the basic tools to start working with R programming language. There are plenty of books, manuals, tutorials, etc. that can be used to complement this course indeed. The programme is structured in four weeks and the material coded while watching the lectures are collected in here accordingly. 

## Week 1:  Getting Started and R Nuts and Bolts

This week is where the very basics of the language are presented. In the folder Week 1 one finds the *.R files coded while reading the notes to get the hands on:

* R-language history and Introduction to the console evaluation
* Data Types: objects, vectors, lists, matrices, factors, missing values (NA and NaN), data frames 
* Reading data from files: tabular data, large table (RAM rules and speeding up the process by sapply(classes))
* Subsetting: from single to double bracket, passing through the dollar symbol. 
* Removing missing values: creating boolean vectors identifying the wrong-value (NA) positions.

## Week 2: Programming with R

## Week 3: Loop Functions and Debugging

## Week 4: Simulation & Profiling
