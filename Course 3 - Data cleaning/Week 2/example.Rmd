## The HDF5 

This lecture is devoted to reading data bases in HDF5 format, a highly structured format that allows us to have <em>groups</em> of data types in a very compact (heirarchical) way.

* Groups have a <em>group name</em> and <em>group symbol table</em>, which has a list of objects in each group


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
